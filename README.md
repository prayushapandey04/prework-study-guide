# Prework Bootcamp Study Guide!

## Description

Here is a prework bootcamp study guide I created in order to help me with the prework topics, before my bootcamp starts. I built this project in order to learn different languages and get my own sense of the different programs necessary to create a website. In this project I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This prework bootcamp helps us break down the different languages in order to build a basic webpage. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can see the different elements, for loops, arrays, and etc required to build what we have built. This project also helps to see the console in the DevTools so we can see the JavaScript program running.
